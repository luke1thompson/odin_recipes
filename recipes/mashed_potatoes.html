    <p>An easy way to make delicious mashed potatoes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3-4 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 sticks of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot of water on the stove on high heat, bring to boil.</li>
        <li>While you wait for the water to boil, peel the potatoes
            and chop them into large cubes, about an inch or two on a side.</li>
        <li>Add the potato chunks to the boiling water. Reduce temperature to medium-high,
            just enough to keep the water simmering.
        </li>
        <li>The potatoes are done once the are soft enough to cut with a fork.
            This should take between 10-15 minutes. Test them regularly, and 
            don't be afraid to taste them.
        </li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes. Return them to the pot, and mash them.
            You can use a masher, but almost any utensil can work in a pinch.
        </li>
        <li>Add the butter, milk, and a few tablespoons of salt and pepper to the potatoes.
            Blend the ingredients together, you may need to put the pot back onto low
            heat if the mixture cools to much.
        </li>
        <li>Taste the potatoes, adding more salt, pepper, and milk as needed.</li>
    </ol>
